## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” User selects videos or playlists from the Appilot dashboard for analysis.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot uses UI Automator or API integration to fetch viewer engagement metrics, including likes, watch time, and retention curves.  
3. **Heatmap Generation** â€” Data is processed and visualized as a color-coded engagement heatmap.  
4. **Output or Action** â€” The system exports the heatmap to dashboards, reports, or CSV for further optimization planning.  
5. **Other Functionalities** â€” Built-in retry logic, logs, and batch processing ensure stable data collection and visualization even across large libraries.
